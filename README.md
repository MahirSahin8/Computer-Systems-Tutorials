## ⚙️ Environment Setup
1. Installed **Homebrew** for package management.  
2. Installed **NASM** assembler via Homebrew:  
   ```bash
   brew install nasm

nasm -v

mkdir ~/Desktop/AssemblyTest && cd ~/Desktop/AssemblyTest

## 🚀 Next Steps (Tutorial 2 Preview)
- Explore more advanced Assembly operations (loops, arrays, conditions).  
- Study how **Irvine Library** is used for Windows-based examples.  
- Learn how to print numerical values instead of text only.  
- Continue versioning each tutorial in this repository for future reference.
